# Simlulation-of-OLX
Program made with the help of C++ and Data Structures  to show the working of OLX among users for buying and selling of products.
This program has a USER Interface as well an interface for the ADMIN of the system, to manage the users.
This project was given to me as a 4th SEM project from my college NMIT,Bangalore.
